# Text-Hiding-in-digital-image-processing-using-Steganography
In this project, we will be focussing on image-based steganography, i.e. hiding secret data in an image.This paper includes the important steganography methods and the main focus is on the review of steganography in digital images. Data privacy and data security are always on highest priority in the world. We need a reliable method to encrypt the data so that it reaches the destination safely. Encryption is a simple yet effective way to protect our data while transmitting it to a destination. The proposed method in this project has state of art technology of steganography and encryption.
